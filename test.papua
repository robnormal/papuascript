/*
	WHY THIS IS NOT OK: toInt x = parseInt x 10
	I wanted it, but it doesn't work, because of nullary functions.
	What does this following mean? 

	foo.bar = print(foo)

	It's ambiguous - could be setting foo.bar to the value
	returned by calling print now, or it could be a function
	that takes no arguments and calls that
